# Update-FX-Selection-Grandma2-LUA
An lua script that finds effect that include a group and swap it with the group clone. For updating effects when cloning new fixtures.


For this to work, you will need to have groupnames that correspond with the script.

You will need to have original groups called (Wash, Spot, Beam, Strobe, Blinder), and the script will ask you which one to run. You will have to run one time per group that you need to update.

You must also have a group called (Wash Sym) with a symmetrical selection from left to right,

in addition you can have LX based groups up to 3, IE: LX1 Wash, LX2 Wash, LX3 Wash



For the clone groups you want to exchange the effect selection, you need following names (IE with wash):

Wash Clone, Wash Clone Sym , LX1 Wash Clone, LX2 Wash Clone, LX3 Wash Clone


Good luck! hope this plugin helps your programming.
